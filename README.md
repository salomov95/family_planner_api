### Architecture

#### What is MVC
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MVC (Model/View/Controller), is a software architecture where a given application is split in three main layers. The first one is the Model layer, where the data is treated, stored and retrieved if necessary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second layer is the Controller, there is where the business logic come, making a bridge between the Model and the View. Lastly is the View layer, that is responsible for handling with user's request and for delivery responses to the user.

#### Why MVC
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being one of the most used architecture in web development, it ease's the pain of of creating one on it's own, which is pretty hard to accomplish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This choice plays a major role in this project due to its simplicity and modularity, in which helps in developing, testing and maintaining software.
